## Four ways to perform a Granger Causality test with R

The Granger causal test is widely used in time series analysis, but the various ways in which it may be performed in R are poorly documented. 
I published before a function to perform the Toda-Yamamoto bivariate and multivariate versions of the Granger causality test (see at [Toda-Yamamoto-Causality-Test](https://github.com/nicolarighetti/Toda-Yamamoto-Causality-Test/blob/main/README.md)). 

In [this document]( https://github.com/nicolarighetti/Granger-causality-test-with-R/blob/main/Granger-test-with-R.md), I am going to focus on its standard version, suggesting four different approaches.
